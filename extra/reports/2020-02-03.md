- Reorganized tests with more than 220 unit tests (previously ~50 tests).

- Implemented the `rational` type. Rational values enable easy formulation of computations, like percentage and ratio. For example, in the following snippet, the exec action transfers 20% of the transferred amount to the argument address `dest`:

```
archetype rational_rat_tez_mult
action exec (dest : address) {
effect {
    var m = 0.2 * transferred;
    transfer m to dest
    }
}
```

It is transcoded to `amount div 5` where `div` is the euclidean division.

- Implemented the `duration` type. Duration values are used to compute dates by addition/subtraction of a duration to a date. In the following snippet, the exec action transfers if current date is one week after `last_exec` date

```
archetype rational_duration

variable last_exec : date = 2020-01-01

action exec (dest : address) {
  called by admin
  effect {
      if now > last_exec + 1w then (
      last_exec := now;
      transfer transferred to dest
      )
  }
}
```
