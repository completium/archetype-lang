The archetype team is working hard to finalize the 1.0 version of archetype compiler,
but we are not yet satisfied for a stable release.

In order to have the most transparency between syntax and execution,
and efficiency for the comprehension of archetype language,
we decided to change the way of how asset structure is used :
- asset type is not authorized on variables and parameters.
- asset literal is only reserved to `add` and `(add)update` api storage functions.
- asset collection and partition must be initialized by empty container.
- asset must be always invoked with its associated key, for field accessing.


With these changes, there is less ambiguity with the manipulation of assets.

We plan for a next feature to implement anonymous record, for structure with named fields.


In the same times, some features were implemented and some bugs were detected and fixed,
so we decide to release another intermediate version of compiler: 0.1.14.

vscode extension is also updated.
