The Archetype team is finalizing the 1.0 version of Archetype transcoder. It will provide full support for LIGO and Whyml generation.

Following feedbacks from early adopters, Archetype syntax has been enhanced:

- The `get` method is removed from the asset collection API; retrieveing an asset is now done straightforwardly from its key with map-like bracket syntax; for example, the syntax to access field `f` of asset with key `k` from the
`my_asset` collection is now :

```
my_asset[k].f
```

As a consequence, it is no more possible to create a local asset variable, which could make believe you were dealing with an object physically detached from the storage, while the reality was that fields updates were automatially synchronised with the storage.

The double update syntax is sill valid though: for example, in order to update integer field `f` to `1` the following two expressions are possible:

```
my_asset.update(k, { f = 1 });
```
```
my_asset[k].f := 1;
```

- It is now possible to update asset collection fields straightforwardly in the update syntax; for example, consider the following assets declaration:

```
asset simple_asset {
  str : string;
}

asset my_asset {
  id : string;
  assets : simple_asset collection
}
```

The following instruction adds 2 simple assets to the `assets` fields of asset with key `"k"`:

```
my_asset.update("k", { assets += [{"str1"},{"str2"}] });
```

The LIGO generated code has been improved and optimized to reduce its size, including:
* use of native LIGO syntax to access maps
* transcription of an asset collection to a map or a set, based on its structure and usage

At laset, on the verification side, the Whyml Archetype theory is being is being verififed. It is the library the whyml-transcoded contract relied on.
